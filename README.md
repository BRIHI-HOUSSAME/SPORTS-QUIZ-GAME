# Hangman Sports

This reimagined Hangman game offers users an immersive experience in the world of sports by allowing them to choose from different categories such as football, basketball, tennis, etc. The challenge is to guess words or phrases associated with the selected category using a limited number of attempts.

## Game Instructions

### Category Selection
The user starts by choosing a sports category from the available options.

### Guess the Word
The interface allows the user to guess the word by selecting letters from the alphabet. Each correctly guessed letter reveals its position in the word. Note: a letter may appear multiple times in the word. Incorrect letters will be counted as failed attempts.

### Selection Restriction
Each selected letter will be disabled after use to prevent repetitions.

### Progressive Display
When the user correctly guesses a letter, the drawing related to the chosen sports category will begin to display progressively. The more letters are guessed correctly, the more the drawing is revealed.

### Victory Animation
Once the user manages to guess the word before exhausting their attempts, the drawing will be complete, and a special animation, specific to the category, will be triggered to celebrate the victory.

### Replayability
Users can replay as many times as they want. They can either replay a new game in the same category or switch categories to discover new sports-related words and challenges.
